<p id="legal_concern"text-align: left;><strong>RE: Formal Demand to Vacate the Property</strong></p>
<p id="concern" style="text-align: justify;">
    Dear Mr. Doe, <br> <br>

    I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request that you vacate the property you have been occupying in light of ongoing issues regarding your rental payments. According to our records, it has been over a year since your last rent payment, and despite your assurances communicated through multiple promissory notes, you have continually failed to meet your financial obligations. This pattern has caused significant distress to my client, Steve Fox, who has been exceedingly patient during this time. <br> <br>

    As you are aware, the financial agreement in place requires timely payment for the use of the property, a critical component in sustaining such arrangements. The failure to remit these payments has not only jeopardized my client's trust but has also incurred additional financial burdens, as he has been unable to rent the property to other potential tenants. The accumulated outstanding balance now stands at â‚±100,000 which must be settled in conjunction with your immediate departure from the premises. <br> <br>

    We hereby demand that you vacate the property within a period of [insert number of days] days from the receipt of this letter. Additionally, we expect you to address the rental arrears in full. Should you fail to comply, we may be compelled to pursue legal routes to reclaim the property and recover what is owed. <br> <br>

    Please consider this matter seriously. It is in everyone's best interest to resolve this issue amicably and without the necessity of legal intervention. I urge you to adhere to the terms of our agreement and rectify this situation promptly. <br> <br>

    Please be guided accordingly.

</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Truly yours,</p>
